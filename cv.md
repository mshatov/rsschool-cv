## About me

Being  an  experienced  Mechanical  Design  Engineer,  I  have  reached  a  glass  ceiling  in  my  field,  so I am looking for a more dynamic and vibrant industry.

I've managed to get some experience on frontend development through courses and self-education. I found IT industry and particularly frontend development field interesting and challenging.

My goal is to become a part of a professional team to contribute valuable and life-changing international projects as a frontend developer.
